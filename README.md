How RiSE Uploads work


RiSE uploads are broken down into multiple sections for customization and flexibility. Not all sheets may or will be used in your RiSE project but they are there if deemed necessary.

We give you the speed, flexibility, and customization to craft out your uploads in RiSE.

Each sheet is broken down with multiple fields and instructions per file located here: 

collection_upload.md
customer_upload.md
offer_upload.md
order_upload.md
product_meta_upload.md
product_upload.md
subscription_upload.md
user_upload.md
